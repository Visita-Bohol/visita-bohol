When he arrived at the place he said to them, \"Pray that you may not undergo the test.“ After withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling, he prayed, saying, \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me; still, not my will but yours be done.“ (And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him. He was in such agony, and he prayed so fervently that his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground.) When he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief. He said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.\n\nTHE WORD OF THE LORD.\nThanks be to God.\n\n𝘼 𝙢𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙨𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙥𝙧𝙖𝙮𝙚𝙧 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙧𝙚𝙛𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙛𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙤𝙬𝙨.\n\nEternal Father, I offer Thee the merits of the Most Precious Blood of Jesus, Thy Beloved Son, and my Divine Redeemer, for the propagation and exaltation of my dear Mother the Holy Church, for the safety and prosperity of her visible Head, the Holy Roman Pontiff, for the cardinals, bishops and pastors of souls, and for all the ministers of the sanctuary.

He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people.

Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?“ Jesus answered, \"My kingdom does not belong to this world.
